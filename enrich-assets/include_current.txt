# **********COMMENTS SECTION***************************************************
#
# This list has been reviewed by the IAB MTF Spider & Robot Policy Board.
# The file contains a list of patterns that may be matched against HTTP User 
# Agent (UA) strings to determine whether that UA matches a known browser. This
# is one step of several required for compliance to IAB Advertising Measurement
# Guidelines. 
# 
# The list is only valid for use with Client Side Counting (CSC) transactions.
# See [http://www.iab.net/iab_products_and_industry_services/508676/guidelines/campaign_measurement_audit] for more info
#
# A User Agent must contain one of these patterns in order to be included
# in impression counts.
#
# It is strongly suggested that users analyze their own log data and then sort 
# this list in order of frequency to allow the filter program to work 
# efficiently. The order presented below is based on an analysis performed by 
# ImServices but may not be representative of all traffic.
#
# This list is provided in good faith but must be used at the user's own risk.  
# The IAB, ABCe and ImServices accept no responsibility for any 
# legal, technical or commercial consequences arising from the use of this 
# list. 
#
# Special characters in this file:
#	# - (only at the start of a line) this line is a comment 
#	| - field separator 
# blank lines may be present. ignore them.
#
# The fields are delimited by a pipe symbol [|]:
#
# 1) pattern - case insensitive string to match
# 	reserved characters are URL-escaped if present (=%7C, #=%23)
# 2) active flag
# 	1=pattern is active and should be matched
# 	0=pattern is inactive, and should ignored
# 3) start-of-string flag
# 	1=pattern must occur at the start of the UA string
# 	0=pattern may appear anywhere within the UA string
# 4) **Inactive Date. Inactive User Agent List Only.
# 	mm/dd/yyyy format
#
# UA strings are potentially valid if they contain one of the following 
# patterns (note: patterns are case insensitive, but shown in this file in 
# mixed case for human legibility)
#
# Contact ImServices Group in the U.S. (spiders.bots@imservicesgroup.com) or 
# ABCe in the UK (spiders.bots@abce.org.uk) with any feedback 
# regarding this file.
